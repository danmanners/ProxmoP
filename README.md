# ProxmoP

Making the Proxmox REST-like API Better

# Description

This project started about two years back. It's goal was to make the reasonably obtuse and hard to use Proxmox API easier to use by wrapping the commands around an easier system.

Looking back at this code in June 2020, I'm a bit embarassed by the state of this. Nonetheless, I'm making this code public in the hope I can re-start this project with some new goals in mind.
